      I am a Software Engineer @ AI Platform Teams @ <b>Bloomberg L.P.</b>

      As a rising software engineer, I enjoy solving problems and building extensible solutions. My goal is to inspire others like me to look at the bigger picture and create more scalable solutions.  This website contains all of my past and current projects that have solutions to beneficial problems. I hope that many others can extrapolate information and make them better.

      I was also a TA for <strong> Intro to Data Science </strong> with Professor Pascal Wallish @ NYU CDS. Teaching that course has allowed me to help other graduate students reach their full potential and has allowed me to gain a completely different perspective on algorithms.
